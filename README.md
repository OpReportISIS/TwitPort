# TwitPort 0.05

# It's over.

On the 5th of February 2016, TwitPort stopped active development.

# Big fucking deal!

;'(

# Why?

Because I am busy and because it's stable asf and doesn't need updating.


# Will there be any more updates?

Probably not

# Special thanks

Thanks @antman1337, without you TwitPort would have never existed

Thanks myself (@ftpskid) without you TwitPort wouldn't be working and be on github

# Okay, we get it - bye bye.

Toodle pip!
