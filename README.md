# What is TwitPort?

TwitPort is a tool designed to report users automatically on a specific list, if you have no list -- it will use anonops targets


# Does it need my password?

Nope. Download the CRX, drag it into chrome and just click the icon. Leave the tab and it will report away.

# Where can I download it?
http://goo.gl/nsRVX7 -- Official download link

# I need help

Contact @ftpskid on Twitter

# How often is it released?

Updates try to be released weekly.

# I don't have a list

No problem, by default TwitPort will connect to AnonOps servers and report accounts automatically - no need for your own list

# I want to use my own list

Sure, use only twitter names on a pastebin or ghostbin paste, for example:

abadaccount864

DO NOT USE: @abadaccount864 else it will not work

# I've created a cool list and want it featured

DM me the list on Twitter -- @ftpskid and I will maybe add it
