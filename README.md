# TwitPort 0.05

# It's over.

On the 5th of February 2016, TwitPort stopped active development.

# Big fucking deal!

;'(

# Why

There really isn't need for something such as it anymore and I am off to work on better things.

# Will there be any more updates?

Probably no

# Special thanks

Thanks @antman1337, without you TwitPort would have never existed

Thanks myself (@ftpskid) without you TwitPort wouldn't be working and be on github

# Okay, we get it - bye bye.

Toodle pip!
